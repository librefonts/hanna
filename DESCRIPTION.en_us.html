  Woowa Brothers, a company dedicated to contributing to the world&acirc;&euro;&trade;s graceful progress by utilizing information technology, has created the &acirc;&euro;&tilde;Hanna&acirc;&euro;&trade; font for everyone to use.
Hanna reflects Woowa Brothers&acirc;&euro;&trade; kitsch and retro identity; it is reminiscent of our childhood memories of trying to draw something really nice, yet our drawing turns out to be a little rough and half-baked.
Hanna is just like that kid&acirc;&euro;&trade;s drawing, and will bring you back to the time when you were little.
Enjoy and share!
